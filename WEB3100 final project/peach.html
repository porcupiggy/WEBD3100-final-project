      <h3>How I Got Peach</h3>
      <p>I got peach in 2022 after my mom informed me that her neighbour found a bunch of kittens in their barn! My mom 
        immediately took all the kittens to foster them until they found a home! I ended up taking peach and my mom took 
        one of the kittens as well and she nanmed him cal. Peach loves visiting my moms house so that him and cal can play together!.</p>

      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>Peach is a special little guy, he is 100% an orange cat to say the least. He will chase the shadows that come through windows, he chews on people's hair,
        he is afraid of ceiling fans for some odd reason that we cannot and probably will never figure out why but it's what makes him special! He may terrorize the house and
        his siblings but peach can also be a very sweet little guy, he loves to cuddle in the morning and is always looking for pets. wouldn't trade him for the world.</p>
