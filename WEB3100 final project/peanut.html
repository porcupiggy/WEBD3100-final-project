      <h3>How I Got Peanut</h3>
      <p>I got peanut in 2023 when a friend of mine sent me a photo of this cat that was looking for a home! the ad was in bridgewater so we drove 
        all the way to bridgewater and picked up this cat and brought him home to add to the family! .</p>

      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>Peanut is the biggest sook ever! He always wants to be around me and will constantly walk under my feet. He does occasionally like to bite ankles but that's only 
        on rare occasions lol. Peanuts FAVOURITE treats are the squeezable tubes! he will bite and tear at the packaging everytime i bring one out. Another thing about peanut
       is he loves to try and escape out the door at any given chance, he will wait by the door when he knows someone is gonna open it and then he will book it, but he never goes far
      and he always just sits and waits for me to go get him so i don't think he really wants to be outside, i think he just likes the thrill of escaping lol love him to death tho.  </p>
