      <h3>How I Got Pinot</h3>
      <p>Pinot's story is a little bit of a long one. It all started in 2021 when my mom was told by a friend that she knows someone who 
        has been having stray kittens show up on their deck for the past week, my mom being the person she is asked the owner of the house if it'd be okay for her
        to come back and try to catch these kittens and they said yes. Fast forward to a few failed attempts as trying to capture them, my mom one day asked me to 
        come with her to try and get these kittens, so i went. When we arrived at the house the kittens were on the deck but they ran and hid before we could even get close,
        and that's when i noticed one tiny little kitten sleeping on the deck not aware that we were there. So i told my mom to throw a blanket over her and put her in the
        carrier an that is exactly what we did and i ended up taking the kitten back home with me to keep. She was a very sick and terrfied little kitten but thankfully i
        was able to get her back to good health and i just had to keep her! she is the sweetest little girl and she is so tiny even at 5 years old. She was my very first cat 
        i ever owned independently and i am so happy i found her when i did!

      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>Pinot is a very quiet little kitty, she barely meows and when she does you can't even hear it, it's like a whisper meow. she loves being centre
        of attention, if you are standing around she will put her paws on your leg or she'll head butt you. She will always do tricks for attention! i've never taught her 
        any tricks but she will roll over and do somersaults to make people pay attention to her and it's the cutest thing ever. She's a funny little girl
