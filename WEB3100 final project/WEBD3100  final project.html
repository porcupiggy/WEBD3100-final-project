      <h2>Welcome to About My Cats</h2>

    <p>
      This website is to show off my beautiful children and their very different personalities.
      Each section is filled with details about them and their little quirks, what they love the most, and how I got them.
      This site is meant to be a creative way to give an outlook on my cats, and I hope this little glimpse into who they are gives you joy as much as they bring me!
