for this assignment i wanted to do a website about my cats and these are the tools i used
1. pixlr - i used this photo editing site to edit the photos of my cats
2. w3schools - i used this website to help me with the CSS page because i had a very specific image in my head of how i wanted the pages to look and needed a bit of guidance on some of the things!
3. visual studiop code - i used this to write my HTML pages and my CSS page
- the planning of this website was the easy part for me i knew when i decided to do this for my website that i wanted a home page and 3 pages for each of my cats that explain each of them and their personalities.
- this website took alot of testing mostly because of the css page, everytime i thought i had it all correct, the css wouldn't be matched up with one of the html pages so i'd have to go back and look through my html pages to see what was causing the issue
